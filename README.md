# DocumentCloud Internet Archive Export Add On

This DocumentCloud Add-On allows you to backup your DocumentCloud project's to DocumentCloud's Internet Archive (archive.org) account. 
See https://archive.org/details/@documentcloudupload for all documents currently backed up on archive.org 

If you fork this project, you can set your own repository secrets, name them IA_USER (your internet archive username) and IA_PASS (your internet archive password) and that will allow you to backup your projects to your own Internet Archive account. 

This Add-On was developed using the Internet Archive's Python Library. You can read more about their Python Library here:
